## My Project Idea

My plan is to use Sean Lahman's Baseball database to investigate and expound upon a curious baseball statistic that I saw online earlier this semester. Namely, I wish to investigate potential causes of the fact that total strikeouts in the MLB have increased year over year for the past thirteen years. As of now, I have access to the Lahman dataset, which I accessed as a package in R, but it only goes up to 2016 I believe. However, on Sean Lahman's website, there is data up to 2017, so I added this to my repo.

```{r}
B_2017 %>%
  filter(yearID %in% 2000:2017) %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(total_SO = sum(SO)) %>%
  arrange(desc(yearID))
```
